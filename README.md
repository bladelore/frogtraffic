# frogtraffic

In the last 10 years, there has been an increase in research showing that frogs have a tendency to increase the pitch of their calls in response to traffic noise. This project aims to highlight how this has occurred in Victoria, focusing on two widely researched species, ‘Litoria ewingii’ (the Southern brown tree frog) and ‘Crinia signifera’ (the Common eastern froglet). I attempted to replicate the research found in paper's like 'Parris, Kirsten M., et al. “Frogs Call at a Higher Pitch in Traffic Noise.” Ecology and Society, vol. 14, no. 1, 2009.
